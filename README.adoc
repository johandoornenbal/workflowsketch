= Basic ideas of this workflow implementation

1. Use a statemachine that returns the state of a given domain entity
2. The statemachine uses the domain entity as the single entry-point for required data
3. The statemachine sets the (next) state on the domain
4. The statemachine should always try to advance through the workflow states as far as possible (the 'marble slide' model)
so: either it reaches an endpoint in the workflow, or meets an unsatisfied guard when attempting to do so
This is behaviour is implemented by
[source,java]
WorkFlowStateMachineAbstract#transition

5. Use a task service to maintain tasks depending on the state of the domain entity
6. Tasks should be nothing more than pointers to the next action to be performed on the domain entity
and - optionally - to the role and/or person who has to do the job. This can be a point of discussion.

7. In this implementation we trigger both the statemachine and the task service by an (update) event.
The listener first calls the statemachine to set the state of the domain entity.
Then it calls the task service to maintain the tasks for the domain entity (in it's new state).

== advantages over the current model:
- less persisted entities (we can get rid of transitions) -> easier to 'repair' when providing user support
- since the domain entity is the single entry-point for all data required to determine it's state it is easy to
initialise it again when - for instance - rules (guards) for the workflow change. (take all the marbles and run them down the slide again)
- model is easier to grasp (I hope / think) and can be implemented in a naive way to start with, being refined when the
situation demands it. (In my example I have put all the information / methods regarding workflow on the invoice itself to illustrate this)
- the statemachine can be tested using Junit tests making it agile and easy to adapt to workflow changes asked for by the business

ad 1.
Methods defined in the interface are:
[source,java]
----
transition(WithWorkFlow domainObject)
----

Returns the domain entity with it's state as far down the workflow as possible
		a given state returns the next state(s) that can be reached together with it's guard (conditions)
		the method comprises initialising
[source,java]
----
initialise(WithWorkFlow domainObject)
----
Returns the domain entity with it's state set to an initial state of the workflow;


ad 2.
The data to be provided by the domain entity is used in order to determine if a guard tied to a possible next state in the
workflow is satisfied or not. (The guards are the 'holes' in the marble slide model)

ad.5
Method defined in the interface:
[source,java]
----
void maintainTasksFor(final WithWorkFlow domainObject, final WorkFlowActor actor);
----
of which the actor is optional
